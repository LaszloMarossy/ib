# WebSocket Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of the WebSocket components in the ib-server module to eliminate code duplication and modernize the WebSocket infrastructure.

## Changes Made

1. **Deprecated BitsoOrderbookMonitorEndpoint**
   - Marked the class as `@Deprecated`
   - Added JavaDoc explaining the reason for deprecation
   - Added logging to track any potential usage
   - Removed registration from WebSocketConfig

2. **Enhanced OrderbookPublisherService**
   - Added additional logging to track usage
   - Added message counting and uptime tracking
   - Improved error handling

## Rationale

The application had two components providing similar functionality:

1. **BitsoOrderbookMonitorEndpoint**: A legacy WebSocket endpoint using direct WebSocket connections
2. **OrderbookPublisherService**: A modern service using Spring's STOMP messaging infrastructure

The client application (OrderbookWsClient) was already using the STOMP-based approach, connecting to the "/topic/orderbook" destination published by OrderbookPublisherService. There were no active clients using the BitsoOrderbookMonitorEndpoint.

## Future Steps

1. **Monitor for Usage**: After deploying these changes, monitor the logs for any connections to the deprecated BitsoOrderbookMonitorEndpoint.
2. **Complete Removal**: If no connections are detected after a reasonable period (e.g., 1-2 months), the BitsoOrderbookMonitorEndpoint can be completely removed from the codebase.
3. **Client Verification**: Verify that all client applications are properly using the STOMP-based approach.

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. Restore the BitsoOrderbookMonitorEndpoint registration in WebSocketConfig
2. Revert the deprecation annotations and logging changes
3. Use the backup file (BitsoOrderbookMonitorEndpoint.java.bak) if needed
